# Migration from Next.js (web) to Tauri (desktop)

This directory contains documentation for the migration from the existing Next.js web application to a Tauri-based desktop application. This PR adds an initial scaffold and a migration plan.

See the detailed plan: docs/migration/plan.md

Goal: provide a clear migration path, initial desktop scaffold, and next actionable tasks to complete the migration.
