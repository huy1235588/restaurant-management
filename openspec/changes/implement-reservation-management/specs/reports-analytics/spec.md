# Spec: Reports and Analytics

**Capability:** `reports-analytics`  
**Change:** `implement-reservation-management`  
**Type:** New Capability

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: All Dashboard & Analytics Features

All reports and analytics functionality has been deferred to Phase 2. The MVP does not include:
- Reservation dashboard with metrics
- Occupancy reports and time slot analysis
- Customer insights and no-show analysis
- Peak hours heatmaps and trend analysis
- Cancellation analytics and reporting
- Revenue impact analysis and forecasting
- Staff performance metrics
- Table utilization reports
- Special occasions tracking
- Booking lead time analysis
- Waitlist performance metrics
- Trend forecasting and demand prediction
- Report scheduling and export (PDF, CSV, Excel)
- Custom report builder

#### Scenario: Reports deferred to Phase 2

**Given** an MVP implementation focuses on core reservation operations  
**When** evaluating feature scope  
**Then** all reports and analytics are documented as Phase 2 future work

## Notes on Deferral

These features will be re-evaluated for Phase 2 after MVP launch. They require:
- Historical data accumulation (minimum 30-90 days of operational data)
- Business stakeholder input on what metrics matter most
- Charting library evaluation (Recharts, Chart.js, or similar)
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Report export infrastructure
- Potential third-party analytics integration
